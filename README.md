# Me

What's up, I am Unreal (he/him), and I am a back-end dev, usually using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (and JavaScript) in NodeJs environment, I've also experimented with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) a bit of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 🦀. I've been developing stuff for a considerable amount of time, usually doing things related to the Discord API.

## Recently...

Here is a brief summary of my personal projects and projects I participate in:

[Jast](https://github.com/jastts/jast) is a fully typed language for making bots for Discord.
[JastCore](https://github.com/jastts/jast/tree/main/packages/core) is a NodeJs library for interact with Discord API.

I also maintain and write some stuff in Simo [API](https://github.com/Simo-Workspace/Botlist-Api), an API to provide information to the Simo's website.
