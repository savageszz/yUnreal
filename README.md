**Make each day unique**

Who am I? I'm Hiago, popularly known as **unreal**. My goal as a software developer is to make every day unique and special, solving real community problems, contributing to open source projects, writing unique things. TypeScript and I, we are almost like a couple, something inseparable. My main language will always be TypeScript, because it is so easy to learn and because of its enormous complexity in its types.

What do I do? I usually create packages to make other developers' lives easier. But I also love sharing my knowledge with other users (Especially on Discord), about databases, TypeScript, runtimes and others.

**Create the Next One**

Just like me, you too can create the next big thing for the market. Learning is never enough. This year I experienced a lot of interesting things, like type complexity, I wrote my own validation library with Bun **([Novi](https://github.com/yUnreal/novi))**, I learned Rust, but none of that is enough, we must be hungry for knowledge.

**What's Next?**

In 2025, I plan to be a new developer. My goal is to create a package that makes it easier to interact with mongodb, directly with Bun.

If you have any abour Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, NodeJS, Bun, Deno, Kotlink, MongoDB, ORMs and others or just want to contribute with something, don't hesitate to message me on **X** or **Discord**.
